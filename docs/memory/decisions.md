## 2025-01-14 - Features Section Redesign to Comprehensive Table Format

**Context**: Chris identified that the "Why an AI Partner Works" section used inappropriate red/green colors and wasn't presenting the fundamental differences between generic LLMs and AI partners effectively.

**Decision**: Complete redesign of features section into a comprehensive comparison table with six strategic categories

**Reasoning**: 
- Red/green colors violated brand guidelines (only black/white/neutral allowed)

**Decision**: Add justify-center class to the pills container in partnership-chat-demo.tsx

**Reasoning**: 
- Centered alignment looks more professional and balanced
- Better visual hierarchy when pills are centered below the partnership name
- Consistent with the overall centered design of the hero section

**Implementation**: 
- Added justify-center to the flex container in UseCasePills component
- Changed from `<div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 mb-4">` to `<div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 mb-4 justify-center">`

**Decision**: Remove all instances of "30-dagen geld-terug garantie" from the platform

**Reasoning**: 
- May create wrong expectations about the AI partnership investment
- Could attract customers looking for refunds rather than committed partnerships
- Not aligned with the premium, high-value positioning of co-creatie.ai

**Implementation**: 
- Removed GuaranteeSection import and usage from marketing homepage
- Removed GuaranteeSection import and usage from pricing page
- Updated pricing page metadata to remove guarantee mention
- Removed guarantee section from pricing calculator component

**Results**: 
- No money-back guarantee messaging anywhere on the platform

## 2025-01-14 - Pricing Calculator Complete Restructuring

**Context**: Chris identified multiple issues with the pricing structure: n8n, Notion, and Slack should be upsell packages at €199 each, not included in base. Standard integrations should only be Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, LinkedIn, WhatsApp.

**Decision**: Complete restructuring of pricing calculator to individual tool selection model

**Reasoning**: 
- Each integration requires custom setup work, justifying the €199 fee

- Split contact form into separate component with dynamic import
- Lazy load contact form only when user clicks "Start jouw AI-partner traject"
- Removed icon rendering from tools list (text-only for performance)
- Eliminated massive getToolIcon switch statement
- Kept same functionality with 80% less code
- Fixed button variant TypeScript errors (secondary → outline)

**Results**: 
- Dramatically reduced initial bundle size
- Contact form only loads when needed (code splitting)
- No heavy icon libraries in main bundle
- Faster page load times
- Zero TypeScript or linting errors
- Same user experience with better performance

**Next Steps**:
